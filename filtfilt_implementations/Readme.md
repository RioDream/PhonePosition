#the implementation of filtfilt() function in Matlab

##the c version 

contains filter() and filtfilt() 

The Author says:
Note: in "main C " I demonstrated how to do the zero-phase filtering "filtfilt" by calling "filter.c" twice. I did not prepare another separate "filtfilt.c" since it is straightforward.
TODO: the initialization is now treated as zero by default in my implementation. The MATLAB "filter" function handles more complicated filter initialization methods.


##the c++ version 

contains filtfilt(), and its output is basicly the same as Matlab in my experiments.
